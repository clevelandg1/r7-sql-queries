-- Agent Status Report
-- This report shows the status of all agents and when they last checked in
-- It distinguishes between scan engine assessments and agent-based assessments
-- "Stale" status is defined as an agent that hasn't checked in for 7+ days
-- Created: April 2025

-- Note: The report uses scan type 'G' to identify agent scans vs. other scan types
-- Modify the stale threshold (7 days) as needed to match your organization's requirements
-- This report depends on scan data being properly categorized by type_id in the dim_scan table
